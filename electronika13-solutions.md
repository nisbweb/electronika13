## Question
You have been recruited by a company that manufactures CPUs. The task of
developing a prototype ALU for an upcoming CPU is given to you. The CPU is
meant to work with signed (2â€™s complement) 8-bit numbers. An ALU has several
control signals that select what operation is to be performed. The design
specifications are as follows:

\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Name & Type & Size & Description \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{4}{| c |}{PRIMARY INPUTS} \\
	\hline
	x & Input & 8-bit, signed & Operand 1 \\
	y & Input & 8-bit, signed & Operand 2 \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{4}{| c |}{PRIMARY OUTPUT} \\
	\hline
	out & Input & 8-bit, signed & Final result after computation \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{4}{| c |}{CONTROL SIGNALS} \\
	\hline
	nx & Input & 1-bit & If set, perform 2's complement of the operand 'x' \\
	ny & Input & 1-bit & If set, perform 2's complement of the operand 'y' \\
	f & Input & 1-bit & If set, perform 'x + y' (addition), else perform 'x AND y' \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{4}{| c |}{FLAGS} \\
	\hline
	zr & Output & 1-bit & If 'out' is zero, set to '1', else set to '0'\\
	ng & Output & 1-bit & If 'out' is negative, set to '1', else set to '0'\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

\raggedright
The ALU must be able to produce the following outputs making use of the
different control signals:

* `x + y`
* `x - y`
* `y - x`
* `x AND y`

Also, provide a truth table for the control signals and the output they
produce.

## Answer
You can find the simulation

Control signal table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	nx & ny & f & out \\
	\hline
	0 & 0 & 1 & x + y \\
	0 & 1 & 1 & x - y \\
	1 & 0 & 1 & y - x \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & x AND y \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

## Question
Rahul has just realized that polynomial multiplication is just the linear
convolution of the coefficients. Help him build a hardware circuit for
performing linear convolution using a hardware description language.

## Answer
This solution is written in Verilog HDL. It is a module that performs linear
convolution on two 8-bit numbers.

```verilog
module linear_convolution(A,B,R);

	input [7:0] A, B;
	output [15:0] R;

	wire A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7;
	wire B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7;
	wire C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14;
	wire R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14;

	assign A0 = A[0];
	assign A1 = A[1];
	assign A2 = A[2];
	assign A3 = A[3];
	assign A4 = A[4];
	assign A5 = A[5];
	assign A6 = A[6];
	assign A7 = A[7];

	assign B0 = B[0];
	assign B1 = B[1];
	assign B2 = B[2];
	assign B3 = B[3];
	assign B4 = B[4];
	assign B5 = B[5];
	assign B6 = B[6];
	assign B7 = B[7];

	assign R0 = A0 && B0 ;
	assign {C1, R1} = (A0 & B1) + (A1 & B0); // Continued on next page
	assign {C2, R2} = C1 + (A0 && B2) + (A2 && B0) + (A1 && B1);
	assign {C3, R3} = C2 + (A3 && B0) + (A0 && B3) + (A1 && B2) + (A2 && B1);
	assign {C4, R4} = C3 + (A4 && B0) + (A0 && B4) + (A3 && B1) + (A1 && B3) + (A2 && B2);
	assign {C5, R5} = C4 + (A5 && B0) + (A0 && B5) + (A4 && B1) + (A1 && B4) + (A3 && B2) + (A2 && B3);

	assign {C8, R8} = C7 + (A7 && B1) + (A1 && B7) + (A6 && B2) + (A2 && B6) + (A5 && B3) + (A3 && B5) + (A4 && B4) ;
	assign {C9, R9} = C8 + (A7 && B2) + (A2 && B7) + (A6 && B3) + (A3 && B6) + (A5 && B4) + (A4 && B5);

## Question
Fibonacci numbers are incredibly easy to understand for right? Well here is a
new challenge! Design a digital circuit that generates all the Fibonacci
numbers between 0 and 15.

## Answer
The required sequence is 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, since we are not asking for the
Fibonacci series, but only the numbers. Since the largest number- 13 requires 4
bits, 4 flip-flops are required. T flip-flops are used in this solution. Let us
call them `T3, T2, T1, T0` (`T3` is the MSB and `T0` is the LSB). Similarly,
their outputs are `Q3, Q2, Q1, Q0` respectively.

\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccc|cccc}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{4}{c|}{Present State} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Next State} \\
	\hline
	$Q_3$ & $Q_2$ & $Q_1$ & $Q_0$ & $Q_3^+$ & $Q_2^+$ & $Q_1^+$ & $Q_0^+$ \\
	\hline
	0     & 0     & 0     & 0     & 0       & 0       & 0       & 1 \\
	0     & 0     & 0     & 1     & 0       & 0       & 1       & 0 \\
	0     & 0     & 1     & 0     & 0       & 0       & 1       & 1 \\
	0     & 0     & 1     & 1     & 0       & 1       & 0       & 1 \\
	0     & 1     & 0     & 1     & 1       & 0       & 0       & 0 \\
	1     & 0     & 0     & 0     & 1       & 1       & 0       & 1 \\
	1     & 1     & 0     & 1     & 0       & 0       & 0       & 0 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

\raggedright

The inputs of each flip-flop for each count are obtained using the transition
table of the T flip-flop

| $T_3$ | $T_2$ | $T_1$ | $T_0$ |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |
|   0   |   0   |   1   |   1   |
|   0   |   0   |   0   |   1   |
|   0   |   1   |   1   |   0   |
|   1   |   1   |   0   |   1   |
|   0   |   1   |   0   |   1   |
|   1   |   1   |   0   |   1   |

Using K-maps for $T_n$, we can calculate the individual flip-flop inputs.

\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	$T_3$ & $T_2$ & $T_1$ & $T_0$ \\
	\hline
	$Q_2$ & $Q_2 + Q_3 + (Q_1 . Q_0)$ & $Q_2' . Q_0$ & $Q_1' + Q_0'$ \\
	\hline

Rahul found an old-tech memory solution that he knows how to write, but he's

## Answer
The figure represents a variation of ["Ferrite core
memory"](https://youtu.be/AwsInQLmjXc). This is technology from the 1950's, and
was famously used for the computers on NASA's Saturn V rocket! Each ring
represents a single bit of information, so here, there are 64 bits of data. If
the currents flowing into a ring add up to $i$, then a logical `1` is stored,
otherwise, a logical `0` is stored.

The data stored is as follows (row-wise, from top to bottom)-

## Question
Rahul wants to read and analyze heartbeat signals. Since heartbeat signals are
very low-level signals, help him design a differential amplifier with a high
CMRR, high gain, and high accuracy. The amplifier must provide a gain that can
be varied over the range of 2 to 1000 using a 100 $k\Omega$ potentiometer.

**PTO.**

\pagebreak

## Answer

![Instrumentation amplifier](./img/instamp.jpeg){width=60%}

An instrumentation amplifier is required for this purpose (Why? because we
require high CMRR, gain and accuracy). The input voltages are taken via
electrodes on the skin, or through photo-transistors and an IR LED placed near
the skin. As shown in the figure, it is built in two stages. In the first
stage, $2R_1$ is taken as the series combination of a fixed resistance $R_{1f}$
and a variable resistance $R_{1v}$. The 100 $k\Omega$ potentiometer is used as
$R_{1v}$.

$$2R_1 = R_{1f} + R_{1v}$$

The second stage is usually kept at unity gain, therefore we can select the
values of $R_3$ and $R_4$ to be any practically convenient value, say
10 $k\Omega$. The equivalent gain of both stages combined is their product, so
if the gain of the first stage is $G$, the overall gain is $G \times 1$. Thus
the entire gain of the amplifier is provided by the first stage itself.

$$\text{It is given that }2 \leq G \leq 1000$$

$$\text{The gain of the first stage is given by }G = 1 + \frac{2R_2}{R_{1f} + R_{1v}}$$

$$\text{For maximum gain(i.e. 1000), take }R_{1v} = 0\ \Omega \text{ (minimum R)}$$

\begin{equation} \label{eq:max}
1 + \frac{2R_2}{R_{1f}} = 1000
\end{equation}

$$\text{For minimum gain(i.e. 2), take }R_{1v} = 100\ k\Omega \text{ (maximum R)}$$

\begin{equation} \label{eq:min}
1 + \frac{2R_2}{R_{1f} + 100\ k\Omega} = 2
\end{equation}

On solving equations \eqref{eq:max} and \eqref{eq:min}, we get $R_{1f} =
100.2\ \Omega$ and $R_2 = 50.050\ k\Omega$

Therefore, the entire design is as follows:

| Resistance |            Value            |
|:----------:|:---------------------------:|
|  $R_{1f}$  |        100.2 $\Omega$       |
|  $R_{1v}$  | 0 $\Omega$ to 100 $k\Omega$ |
|    $R_2$   |       50.050 $k\Omega$      |
|    $R_3$   |         10 $k\Omega$        |
|    $R_4$   |         10 $k\Omega$        |
